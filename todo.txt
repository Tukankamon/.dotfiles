Package the waybar config outside home manager (maybe other packages too like niri)

Figure out a way to sort Home manager standalone, I have spread out files for the same program and two places where modified programs could be (home/programs and system/modules)

nvf: map gj to j, gk to k and default clipboard to the system one

Screen brightness on laptop

configure browsers to declare extensions
